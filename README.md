## Project Motivation

Being from India, I wanted to analyze how the Southeast Asia region is doing and more specifically wanted to answer three questions given below:

  - Q1: Which country in Southeast Asia region is leading from the GDP perspective?

  - Q2: Is the leading country from GDP perspective also leading from GDP per capita  perspective?

  - Q3: Would the answer remains the same if we consider purchasing power parity adjusted GDP per capita?

## File Description
  
  No extra data files are available and all data has been pulled from World Bank site via API
  
  Apart than that there is one notebook file, one blog PDF file, one file containing the link of the blog.
  
  
## Results
